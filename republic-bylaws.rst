The Senate shall utilize the following voting standards.

The Republic Forum
==================

Purpose
-------
The purpose of The Republic Forum (also known as "Blue Server"), is to provide a venue for guild leadership to conduct business that affects The Republic as a whole.

Required Channels
-----------------
The following channels shall be required for the normal functioning of The Republic Forum.
Additional channels may be added or archived as required at the discretion of the Chancellor or Vice-Chancellors.
*Nota bene*: Deprecated channels on The Republic Forum may only be archived, not deleted.

``#senate``
```````````
The ``#senate`` channel shall serve as the floor of the Senate.
This channel shall be utilized exclusively for the introduction of motions and casting of votes by Senators.
It shall not, under any circumstances, be utilized for the purposes of discussion.
That said, each Senator shall maintain the right, in the tradition of formal debate, to post a single response to each main motion after it is made, in order for all officers to easily note the manner in which their Senator is representing their guild.
When a vote has been called, Senators *must not post anything except to cast their vote*.
Senators do not have a right to "explain their vote" in their Aye/No response.
If a Senator wishes to provide additional context to their vote, it must be posted in ``#all_officers`` or the appropriate discussion channel.
Viewing access to the ``#senate`` channel shall be granted to all officers, but posting access will be restricted to Senators.

``#all_officers``
`````````````````
The ``#all_officers`` channel shall serve as the primary venue for informal discussion of issues within the Republic.

Discussion Channels
-------------------
Discussion channels shall be created, closed, and archived by the Chancellory as needed.

Following the initial appointment of a Function Group or Special Committee, additional committee members may be appointed at the discretion of the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, or a majority vote of the committee itself.
Such secondary appointments must be reported to the Senate, which reserves the power to review the appointment.
However, a confirming vote is not required.

    * The member or guest submits a written letter of apology that demonstrates contrition and a willingness to improve their behavior, and;

Rules of Order and Standing Rules
=================================

Parliamentary Authority
-----------------------
The Republic will use *Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, 11th edition* as its parliamentary authority.
Whenever these Bylaws, the Standing Rules of the Republic, and the Special Rules of Order remain silent, the procedures laid out in *Robert's Rules* will be considered official Republic procedure.

Special Rules of Order
----------------------
From time to time, issues might arise that require special procedural rules tailored specifically for The Republic's unique manner of meeting via a Discord server.
These rules shall be stored in a single document, curated by the Library Function Group, and housed in the ``#library`` channel for all officers to view.

Standing Rules
--------------
Standing Rules define the standard operating procedures of the Republic leadership, including, but not limited to, recruiting methods, officer training, and guild onboarding.

Introduction of Standing Rules
``````````````````````````````
Standing Rules shall be adopted exclusively by passage of a resolution in written form. The document must be sponsored by a Senator and adopted by an affirmative majority vote.

Storage of Standing Rules
`````````````````````````
Once adopted by the Senate, the document becomes a Standing Rule of the Republic and must be added to the Republic Forum's library channel for easy reference by all officers.

Amendments
==========
Amendments to these Bylaws shall be adopted exclusively by passage of a resolution in written form.
The document must be sponsored by a Senator and adopted by an affirmative two-thirds vote of all Senators.
